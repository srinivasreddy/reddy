### README
I do not want to manage alias in my bash/zsh shell. 

I do not want to maintain alias for `git checkout main` as `gcm` in my ~/.bashrc file.
Likewise, there are many aliases that i do not want to manage. Hence i have created this tool for this.

This tool recreates those alias as symlinks in the package.
