### README
I do not want to manage alias in my bash/zsh shell. 

I do not want to maintain alias for `git checkout main` as `gcm` in my ~/.bashrc file.
Likewise, there are many aliases that i do not want to manage. Hence i have created this tool for this.

This tool recreates those alias as symlinks in the package. 

### Installation

Currently, this package works for only ubuntu systems.  Please go to [Releases](https://github.com/srinivasreddy/reddy/releases)  section in this repo.
And download the version, mostly latest, you want. Then install it like,
